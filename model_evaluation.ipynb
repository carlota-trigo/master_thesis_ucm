    "# 📋 Model Evaluation Compliance Review\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Compliance Issues Fixed\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Model Path Configuration**\n",
    "- **Fixed**: Updated model paths to match actual implementations:\n",
    "  - Baseline: `outputs/base_model/simple_twohead_best_model.keras` (matches `base_model.py` callback config)\n",
    "  - SSL: `outputs/ssl_finetuned/finetuned_best_model.keras` (matches `self_supervised_model.py`)\n",
    "  - Ensemble: Uses `outputs/individual_models/` directory (matches `ensemble_model.py`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Model Loading Robustness**\n",
    "- **Enhanced**: `utils.load_individual_model()` now:\n",
    "  - First tries to load complete model with `keras.models.load_model()`\n",
    "  - Falls back to creating model and loading weights if needed\n",
    "  - Provides detailed error messages and file existence checks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Ensemble Model Compatibility**\n",
    "- **Fixed**: `utils.load_ensemble_models()` now handles both naming conventions:\n",
    "  - `{backbone_type}_model.keras` (used by `ensemble_model.py`)\n",
    "  - `{backbone_type}_best_model.keras` (alternative naming)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Error Handling & User Experience**\n",
    "- **Added**: Comprehensive error handling throughout the notebook\n",
    "- **Added**: Clear warnings when models are not available\n",
    "- **Added**: Helpful instructions for training missing models\n",
    "- **Added**: Graceful skipping of evaluation sections when no models are available\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Model Architecture Compliance**\n",
    "- **Verified**: All three model types use consistent architecture:\n",
    "  - Two-head output structure (coarse + fine)\n",
    "  - Same backbone types (EfficientNetB1, ResNet50, DenseNet121)\n",
    "  - Compatible with `utils.get_predictions_and_labels()` function\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Key Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Robust Model Loading**: The notebook now handles various model saving formats and provides fallback mechanisms\n",
    "2. **Better Error Messages**: Clear feedback when models are missing or fail to load\n",
    "3. **Flexible Evaluation**: Can run with any subset of available models\n",
    "4. **Consistent Interface**: All models use the same prediction and evaluation pipeline\n",
    "5. **User Guidance**: Clear instructions for training missing models\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Expected Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook will now:\n",
    "- ✅ Load available models successfully\n",
    "- ✅ Skip unavailable models with clear warnings\n",
    "- ✅ Provide helpful instructions for training missing models\n",
    "- ✅ Run evaluation on any available models\n",
    "- ✅ Handle ensemble models correctly\n",
    "- ✅ Provide comprehensive comparison when multiple models are available\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Usage Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Train Models** (if not already done):\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python base_model.py\n",
    "   python self_supervised_model.py\n",
    "   python ensemble_model.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run Evaluation**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   jupyter notebook model_evaluation.ipynb\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook will automatically detect and evaluate all available models, providing comprehensive performance analysis and comparison.\n"
